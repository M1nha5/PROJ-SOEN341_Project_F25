## Description
Our project is a web-based application that provides a centralized platform for campus event management and ticketing. The system makes it easier for users to discover upcoming activities, reserve tickets, and check in at events using QR codes. It also supports event organizers by giving them tools to create and manage events, track attendance, and view basic analytics. In addition, administrators are given oversight capabilities to moderate content, approve organizer accounts, and access overall participation statistics. The goal of this project is to deliver a functional prototype that demonstrates these core features and can serve as a solid starting point for a more complete product in the future.

## Objectives
The application is centered around three main roles: users, organizers, and administrators. For users, the focus is on a smooth event experience, including browsing and filtering events, saving them to a personal list, reserving tickets, and checking in with QR codes. Organizers will be able to create detailed event listings, manage ticket availability, and review attendance data through event dashboards, with options to export attendee lists and validate tickets. Administrators will ensure the platform runs smoothly by approving organizer requests, moderating event listings to maintain quality and compliance, and monitoring overall campus engagement trends through global analytics and management tools.

## Languages & Techniques
For this project, we plan to use Java and/or for the backend development and JavaScript for the frontend, alongside supporting languages such as HTML, CSS, and SQL. Java will allow us to build a structured and scalable backend, while JavaScript will be used to create an interactive and responsive user interface. In terms of techniques, we will follow Agile Scrum practices by organizing our work into sprints, writing user stories, and maintaining a backlog of tasks. We will use GitHub for version control, branching, and code reviews to ensure smooth collaboration among team members. Our system will be structured according to the MVC (Model–View–Controller) design pattern, with RESTful APIs connecting the backend to the frontend. We will also make use of prototyping to define the user experience early, and we plan to integrate testing to validate the correctness of core features as they are implemented.
