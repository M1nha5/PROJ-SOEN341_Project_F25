Task: Backend Implementation for Event Chat Feature (Extra Feature)
Activities:

Designed and implemented the backend architecture for the new Event Chat / Live Q&A feature.

Created new Express routes and controllers to handle message retrieval, posting, and event-scoped chat sessions.

Added a dedicated ChatMessage MongoDB collection with fields for event ID, sender, timestamp, and role tagging.

Implemented role-aware handling so organizer messages are flagged and returned with highlighted status.

Ensured chat endpoints fully integrate with existing authentication and authorization middleware.

Added input validation and error handling to prevent empty messages and malformed requests.

Performed local testing using Postman to verify message flow, response structure, and persistence.

Coordinated with frontend teammate to sync API payload formats and enable smooth UI rendering.
Time Spent: ~8.5 hours (6 h implementation + 2 h testing/debugging + 0.5 h integration)
