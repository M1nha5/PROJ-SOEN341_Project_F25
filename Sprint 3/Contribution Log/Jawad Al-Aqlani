Issues: #7, #8, #9 – Organizer Event Creation, Dashboard & QR Validation

Activities:
Developed and refined multiple frontend components for the Organizer interface using React.
	•	US07 – Event Creation Form: Built and styled EventForm.jsx with validation, responsive layout, and mock data integration to display newly created events on the dashboard.
	•	US08 – Organizer Dashboard: Contributed to OrganizerDashboard.jsx, implementing dynamic stats, charts, and counters for real-time event analytics.
	•	US09 – QR Validation Tool: Helped design and test the QR upload/scan UI, integrated mock validation logic, and improved user feedback for invalid codes.

Also optimized component structure, standardized CSS modules, and coordinated with teammates for API alignment and UI testing.

Time Spent: ~12 hours (6h implementation + 4h testing + 2h collaboration)
