Issues: #8, #9, #10 – Admin Approval & Moderation, Admin Stats Dashboard & Email Confirmation for Event Registration

Activities:

US08 – Admin Approval & Moderation Tools:
Worked on AdminDashboard.jsx to let admins manage organizer requests and events. Added two sections: pending organizer approvals (with Approve/Reject buttons) and event moderation (Remove button). Used mock state to update UI instantly when approving, rejecting, or removing an entry. Kept layout simple and consistent with the project style.

US09 – Admin Global Analytics Dashboard:
Created AdminAnalytics.jsx to show high-level platform stats such as number of events, total claimed tickets, and participation trends. Used Recharts to render graphs (bar/pie). Hooked into existing state so data updates automatically. Tested for responsiveness to make sure charts behave properly on different screen sizes.

US10 – Email Notification on Event Registration:
Set up Nodemailer on the backend and built a sendEmail.js utility to send confirmation emails after ticket registration. Hooked it into the /tickets/claim route so emails fire automatically. Email includes basic event details and QR when available. Tested sending, logging, and made sure failures don't crash the app.

Also handled .env setup for email creds, and tested with teammates to confirm admin actions & email flow worked as expected.

Time Spent: ~14 hours (6h coding + 5h testing/fixing + 3h cleanup & integration)
