Issues: #6 – Administrator Dashboard & Moderation, Full System Integration (Frontend + Backend)

Activities:

US06 – Administrator Dashboard & Moderation:
Implemented the Administrator Dashboard for managing event moderation and organizer approval. Created frontend components for displaying pending organizer requests and event listings with “Approve,” “Reject,” and “Remove” functionalities.
Integrated mock JSON data for organizer accounts and event records to simulate backend interactions. Added responsive UI design using CSS modules and ensured clear visual feedback for admin actions.

System Integration (Frontend ↔ Backend):
Connected the frontend React components with the Node.js/Express backend API. Configured REST endpoints for event management and verification between both systems.
Set up proper CORS configuration, environment variables, and MongoDB connection to ensure reliable data exchange.
Verified that all CRUD operations (event creation, ticket claiming, and moderation updates) flow smoothly between the frontend and backend.

Debugged endpoint mismatches and ensured the frontend successfully consumes backend data (e.g., event list rendering, ticket creation, and organizer moderation).
Conducted end-to-end testing to confirm the server (port 5001) and client (port 5173) communicate properly.

Refactoring & Testing:

Helped standardize API routes and response structures between backend modules (eventRoutes.js, organizerRoutes.js).

Tested integration workflows, including admin event approval and student ticket claiming, to verify full-stack stability.

Resolved cross-origin and async request issues during data fetch operations.

Time Spent: ~13 hours (6 h implementation + 4 h integration + 3 h testing/debugging)
