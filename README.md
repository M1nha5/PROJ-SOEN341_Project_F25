## Description
Our project is a web-based application that provides a centralized platform for campus event management and ticketing. The system makes it easier for users to discover upcoming activities, reserve tickets, and check in at events using QR codes. It also supports event organizers by giving them tools to create and manage events, track attendance, and view basic analytics. In addition, administrators are given oversight capabilities to moderate content, approve organizer accounts, and access overall participation statistics. The goal of this project is to deliver a functional prototype that demonstrates these core features and can serve as a solid starting point for a more complete product in the future.

## Objectives
The application is centered around three main roles: users, organizers, and administrators. For users, the focus is on a smooth event experience, including browsing and filtering events, saving them to a personal list, reserving tickets, and checking in with QR codes. Organizers will be able to create detailed event listings, manage ticket availability, and review attendance data through event dashboards, with options to export attendee lists and validate tickets. Administrators will ensure the platform runs smoothly by approving organizer requests, moderating event listings to maintain quality and compliance, and monitoring overall campus engagement trends through global analytics and management tools.
