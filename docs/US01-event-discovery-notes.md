# US.01 – Event Discovery Page

## User Story
As a student, I want to browse and search events with filters (date, category, organization) so that I can easily find the events I’m interested in.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Events must be displayed in a grid/list layout.
- Search bar should allow keyword search by title or organization.
- Filters must allow selection by date range, category, and organization.
- Must be responsive (desktop + mobile).

## Tasks
- **Task.01:** Implement event list UI component in React (EventCard.jsx) with title, date, location, and category.
- **Task.02:** Create search bar + dropdown filter components using React hooks.
- **Task.03:** Integrate mock event data (JSON) and render dynamically.
- **Task.04:** Style components with CSS modules/Tailwind for responsiveness.

## Notes
- This doc is for Sprint 1 planning (non-code change).
- Linked to Issue #1 for traceability.
